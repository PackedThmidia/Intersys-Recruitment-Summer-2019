// Given are two integers m, n (1 <= m <= n <= 10^9, n â€“ m <= 10^5). You have to report the number of prime numbers within the interval [m, n]. First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the test cases you have to handle. T lines follow, each one with two integers m, n as stated above. For each test case, output a single line, containing the requested report.

// Case 1:

// For the input provided as follows:

// 1
// 1 10

// Output of the program will be:

// 4 

// Case 2:

// For the input provided as follows:

// 2
// 100 200
// 1 1

// Output of the program will be:

// 21
// 0
